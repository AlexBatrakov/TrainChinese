# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue.

Instead, report it privately:

- Email: contact the repository owner via their GitHub profile.

Please include:

- Steps to reproduce
- Affected versions/commit hash
- Impact assessment (what an attacker can do)

We will respond as soon as reasonably possible.
